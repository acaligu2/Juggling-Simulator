#Juggling-Simulator
Developed in Xcode using Swift

Are you tired of failing to juggle in real life?

...well then you're in luck! Juggling Simulator is all the fun of 
real juggling, at a fraction of the difficulty!

To begin, tap any of the balls and get the rhythm going for all three.
The game will end when two of the balls end up in the same hand, so keep the juggling
going for as long as you can!

The physics of the game are done using SKActions. When a tap is detected in one of the balls being held, it is
"thrown" to the top of the screen and lands in the opposite hand. A simple timer determines the score
of the game. Once the game is over, the curtains will close and you may restart if you'd like.
